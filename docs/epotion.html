      If you're reading this and you come from any other site, that's using Epotion, please contact them on how your data is actually used. Other sites that are using Epotion are allowed to manipulate the data and process it however they need to. If those sites are using the default setup, then everything below applies to that case.
    </p>

    <p>
        Epotion is not collecting any sensitive and personal data. Epotion is not able to identify the user using the collected data. The things stored are:
        <ul>
            <li>age</li>
            <li>gender</li>
            <li>city</li>
            <li>ip</li>
            <li>country</li>
            <li>emotion</li>
        </ul>
        Things like age, gender and emotion can differ from one measurement to another.
        This data is based on the picture taken while using Epotion tracking and it could be inaccurate.
        As for now, age is something that could be highly inaccurate and in most cases is different everytime the tracking is done.
        It could also happen that city is inaccurate, especially when you're using a mobile network.
    </p>

    <p>
        Collected data is not public. Users are allowed to check data collected for specific URLs, but then `IP` is skipped in the result.
    </p>

    <p>
        Last but not least. Epotion doesn't use cookies or any other methods that could connect/identify users through the sites.
        Every time you reload the page or change the site you browse, you are considered as a different user.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Safety and anonymity are the priority! Epotion understands it very well therefore everything that's being collected should not be considered as sensitive data.
        It was created to help site owners better understand their users' needs and provide better service. Let's grow together üôèüèª
